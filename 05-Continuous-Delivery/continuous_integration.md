Now that you've come to know about what is Continous Integration(CI), learning about Continuous Delivery(CD) and Continuous Deployment(CD) won't be a challenging job. In Software Development, CI-CD goes side by side.

**Continuous Integration(CI)**: It is a software development practice that involves integrating code changes from multiple developers into a shared repository frequently, typically several times a day. Each time a change is made, it is automatically built, tested, and verified by an automated build system to ensure that it integrates well with the existing codebase.

**Continuous Delivery(CD)**: It is an extension of CI that focuses on automating the entire software delivery process, from code changes to production deployment. CD ensures that code changes are automatically built, tested, and deployed to a production-like environment for final user acceptance testing manually. This process is designed to provide feedback to developers quickly and efficiently, allowing them to make improvements before the software is released to production.

**Continous Deployment(CD)**: This is almost same as Continuous Delivery. However, there's one additional step that is taken in consideration. In Continuous Delivery(CD), the code changes are deployed to the production manually. However, in Continous Deployment, code changes are deployed to the production in an automated way after the code passes user acceptance testing
